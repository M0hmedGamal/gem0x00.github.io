# Gogeta

Hello , At first when I saw the website it was like this :
<img width="1145" height="643" alt="Pasted image 20251114230844" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe80b3b2-2c1b-4d2c-af52-485384397f03" />


The source Code is very simple but there is something took my eye :

<img width="471" height="162" alt="Pasted image 20251114230956" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7fb8332-6644-4d3c-a8f4-8de7d4067722" />


After researching the vulnerability and methods of exploitation, the following GitHub issue provided essential insight and a proof-of-concept that facilitated successful exploitation: [https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23867](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23867).

At first i tried the exploit in it :
```
khashaev.ru/go-vuln/index.html
```

that is the online page that carry the payload and it worked :

<img width="913" height="198" alt="Pasted image 20251114232549" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f5d3a6-727e-4e99-90a2-40a09475bd40" />


Then I crafted my own exploit to get the flag and hosted it via `ngrok`:

The Exploit and got the flag :
